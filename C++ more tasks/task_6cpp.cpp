//Task # 6 Create a .cpp file with name variables.cpp and write the programming statements for the following:
 
"	Create a variable without assigning the value, and assign it the value in later statement.
//1 int a;
//a=6; 
    
"	Assign a new value to an existing value (this will overwrite the previous value)
2 //int a=26;
  //a=30;

"	Create an unchangeable variable with the const keyword
3 //const int a=26;
  //a=30;
"	Demonstrate the use of # define directive 
4 //the # define directive causes the compiler to substitute token-string
 //for each occurence of identifierin the source file.
 //the identifier is replaced only when it forms a token.
 //That is identifier, is not replaced if it appears in a comment,
 //in a string or as part of a longer identifier.


"	Combine text and a variable on output  (console window)
/*#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int age=18;
	cout<<"You are "<< age << " years old";
	return 0;
}*/
"	Add a variable to another variable
/*#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	int a=50;
	int b=100;
	cout<<"sum = "<<a+b;
	return 0;
}*/

"	Declare many variables of the same type with a comma-separated list Identifiers 
 /*#include<iostream>
 using namespace std;
 int main(){
 	int a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l; 
 	return 0;
 }*/
"	Define and Initialize two string variables of your own choice
"and concatenate both strings and display the final value. 
/*#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
	string string1="Ghulam Hussain";
	string atring2="Roll number 23SW050";
	return 0;
}*/
"	With suitable programming example explain the concept of signed
"and unsigned variables. (Use comments for explanation)
